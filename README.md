# Embedding-Types

# Introduction
This repository explores multiple text representation techniques applied to a preprocessed corpus. The process involves text preprocessing followed by various embedding techniques, allowing for comparative analysis of traditional and advanced representations. These methods are essential for NLP tasks like classification, similarity measurement, and sentiment analysis.

# Project Workflow
# Text Preprocessing:

Stop Words Removal: Removes frequently occurring words that carry less meaningful information.
Stemming: Reduces words to their root forms, preserving essential semantics.
Corpus Creation: The preprocessed words are saved into a structured corpus.
Embedding Techniques:

TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): Captures the importance of words relative to their frequency in the entire corpus.
One-Hot Encoding: Represents each word as a unique vector, primarily for sparse data representation.
Bag of Words (BoW): Counts word occurrences within documents, capturing term frequency in a non-sequential manner.
Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW): Uses context words to predict the target word, focusing on semantics.
Average Word2Vec: Computes an average vector representation for words using Word2Vec, capturing semantic similarities.

# Requirements
Ensure the following libraries are installed to execute the notebook. Save these in a requirements.txt file and install them using pip install -r requirements.txt.

plaintext
nltk
numpy

Usage
Clone the repository:

# bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
Install the required libraries:

# bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Open and run the notebook to preprocess the text data and generate embeddings. Each section of the notebook covers a distinct embedding technique and provides examples of their usage.

# Project Structure
Data Preprocessing: Removes stop words and applies stemming before creating the final corpus.
Embedding Representations:
TF-IDF: Calculates the relevance of terms within documents.
One-Hot Encoding: Provides unique binary vectors for each word in the corpus.
Bag of Words: Generates word frequency counts in documents.
CBOW: Uses context windows around words for contextual word embeddings.
Average Word2Vec: Aggregates individual Word2Vec vectors to create document-level embeddings.

# Applications
These embeddings are suitable for:

Text Classification: Using these representations as features for predictive models.
Similarity Measurement: Computing semantic similarities between documents.
Clustering and Topic Modeling: Grouping documents by topic based on their embeddings.
